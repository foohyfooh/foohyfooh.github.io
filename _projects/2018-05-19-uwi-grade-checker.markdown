A discussion with a friend about automating the retreival of grades from UWI's system was how I got this idea. This script logins to the UWI site and then goes to the grade section where it scrape the data for the user's latest grades.

It can be found on GitHub at [https://github.com/foohyfooh/uwi-grade-checker](https://github.com/foohyfooh/uwi-grade-checker)
