I was loaned a Sphero BB-8 Droid by my lecturer [Kyle De Freitas](https://github.com/kyledef) and was asked to build something with it.

I made some Node scripts using Sphero.js and Cylon.js which can be found at [run-bb8](https://github.com/foohyfooh/run-bb8). The most notable being demo for the UWI DCIT Meet and Greet 2016.

Later [BB-8 Notifications](https://github.com/foohyfooh/BB-8_Notifications) and [BB-8 Voice Commands](https://github.com/foohyfooh/BB-8_Voice_Commands) were made. BB-8 Notifications was an Android app to receive visual notifications using the BB-8 droid; and BB-8 Voice Commands was made for the 2017 DCIT Meet and Greet with the intention of controlling the droid with voice. <br>
After [BB-8 Apps](https://github.com/foohyfooh/BB-8_Apps) was made with the intent to join the previously mentioned Android apps into a single application and allow for building of more applications.
