During the 3 years of my Computer Science degree, I have had make serveral projects. The ones that were done for courses are listed here.

During my first semester, I had to make do a game as a group assignment for a Web Programming course. The game was [Night-Knight](https://github.com/reshawn/Night-Knight) which can be played [here](http://reshawn.github.io/Night-Knight/). <br>
During the first semester of my third year, as a group project for another Web course, I was involved in the making of an application to help Chemistry students easily keep track of events and get information from their department. It can be found [here](https://github.com/reshawn/uwiChem).

During my last semester, I built a simple mobile alert system for Android devices which can be found [here](https://github.com/foohyfooh/COMP-3275-Project-Alert-System).

And for my final year project, I built a restaurant automation system to make ordering easier for dine-in and take-out customers which can be found [here](https://github.com/foohyfooh/COMP-3990-Project-Restaurant-Automation).
