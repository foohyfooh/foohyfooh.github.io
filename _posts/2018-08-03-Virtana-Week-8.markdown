This week at [Virtana](https://virtanatech.com/) has been spent attempting to build upon my work from [last week](/posts/2018/07/27/Virtana-Week-7.html). I have finished the simplification of the communication process, generating robot output to sent over WebRTC, and testing the system.

The simulation now accepts the commands in a simpler format to update the robot directly rather than needing to be updated by the manufacturer's simulated robot. This means that there are less programs that need to be run for the system to operate. I have also done the work for the simulation to output the robot data that is needed by the WebRTC program.<br>
Now I am testing to see that tasks can be done using the simulation.
