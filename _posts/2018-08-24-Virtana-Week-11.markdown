This week at [Virtana](https://virtanatech.com/) has been spent attempting to build upon my work from [last week](/posts/2018/08/17/Virtana-Week-10.html). I added movement to the Unity calibration target and added a new feature to an tools.

For the camera calibration, the target needed to move around. To accomplish this I added a script that randomly moves the target every 5 seconds. Later, I added a new feature to a tool that we have to control the robot in the system.
