Currently there have been two regions, Alola and Galar, which have introduced regional forms for existing Pokémon. These introduces some interesting dynamics for selecting Pokémon whether it during the regular gameplay or competitive gameplay. But, it also introduces some issues for obtaining them depending on the game you play and this will grow as more games introduce regional forms.

The current issues are:
- Regional forms obtained by evolution of non-regional Pokémon can be difficult depending on the games you have available. In the Alolan games, Kantonian forms couldn't be obtained via evolution during the story, but in the Ultra games they could at least be evolved in the Ultra Space once you completed the story. For the most part this was a reasonable solution, but in the later Kanto and Galar games there is no such mechanic.
- Breeding regional forms from those whose evolutionary line don't require a specific region to evolve is possible, but it requires an Everstone. This introduces the issue that you can't breed for Natures for competitve play.
- Trades for regional forms don't have the option to get all of the forms. In Let's Go all of the existing forms were available but in the Galar games this didn't happen even after the trades for these forms were introduced in the Isle of Armor. While Dynamax Adventures enabled you to get the remaining ones, it not as convenient as a set NPC for this purpose.

My solution to these issues mentioned are:
- Adding breeding of regional forms without the need for an Everstone. An example of this would mean if you breed an Alolan Pokémon in Galar it would still give Alolan Pokémon. This would mean that you don't have to roll for Natures in the trade evolutions and then breed with an Everstone. The form would be dictated by the female parent when breeding with two different regional forms, and by the non-Ditto parent in the case of breeding with Ditto.
- Adding a trade NPC in the Pokémon Centers who requests trades for the forms that appears in the current region for any regional form not in the region. And, for Pokémon like Meowth which have multiple forms there will be an additional dialog option asking for which regional form you are looking for before the trade confirmation dialog.
- Extending the trade NPC to fix the Ability, Nature and IVs of the recieved Pokémon. Trading with a Destiny Knot would trigger this mechanic and the NPC would say something along the lines of "These Pokemon seemed to have had their destiny intertwined" to indicate that this happened. The Pokémon you receive would have the same Nature and IVs and the corresponding Ability of the sent Pokémon along with holding a Destiny Knot. For Pokémon whose evolution require a specific region to evolve this would mean that you can breed for specific Natures and IVs on the Pokémon you want and then get the regional evolution that can't be regularly obtained.
