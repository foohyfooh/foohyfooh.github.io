With the announcement of the remakes for Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, I have thoughts of some of the things I hope that are included. They include the pokedex, movesets, post game stories and post game activities.

## Pokédex
![Pokédex](/images/pokemon/DP_Pokedex.png){:width="100px" height="100px"} <br>
Firstly, I would like that they use the Pokémon Platinum Regional Pokédex. I don't want repeats of what happened with Volkner's team and Flint's team where there aren't enough Fully Evolved Pokémon of their main type. Additionally, they should replace Manaphy with Sylveon in the Regional Pokédex. This would serve two purposes. First, removing a Pokémon that cannot be obtain during the game from the main completion of the Pokédex objective and second, all of the Eeveelutions would be in the Regional Pokédex.

## Movesets
Secondly, some of the movesets should be updated to better match the stronger attacking stat of the Pokémon.

![Torterra](/images/pokemon/sprites/389-torterra.png)
Torterra is a Physical Grass type Pokémon but doesn't get STAB Physical moves past Razor Leaf via level up. It should get access to moves like Seed Bomb or Wood Hammer via level up. This should be changed so that with a playthrough team a player can actually have moves that are suited to its stronger attacking stat.

![Empoleon](/images/pokemon/sprites/395-empoleon.png)
Empoleon on evolution gets Aqua Jet. I believe this move should learnt at some time when it is Prinplup instead and on evolution Empoleon should learn a good Steel type move like Flash Cannon. This change would mean that Empoleon would get a STAB move of its secondary typing that matches its stronger attacking stat similar to what happens with Infernape and Torterra where they get Close Combat and Earthquake repsectively.

## Post Game Stories
Thirdly, I would like post game story content related to Mythical Pokémon. This needs to happen in a similar way to what happened in the Delta Episode with Deoxys.

![Darkrai](/images/pokemon/sprites/491-darkrai.png)
</div>
Cresselia already gets a little story bit in the game in Canalave City, but I believe that Darkrai should also be included in it. Sailor Eldritch's son kinda mentions him as the cuase of his nightmares so it would be nice if he was more incorporated in the story. This will improve the story and remove the need for an event to get Darkrai.

![Arceus](/images/pokemon/sprites/493-arceus.png)
Arceus' event item, the Azure Flute, was never distributed in the original Sinnoh games and thus you couldn't do its post game event legitimately. While Arceus is getting its own game that shouldn't stop it from getting proper treatment in the remakes. And, if it is included in the game, there could also be a reference to the Sinjoh Ruins which appeared in the HeartGold and SoulSilver games.

Furthermore, this kind of changes should also apply to Shaymin and Manaphy as well.

## Post Game Activities
Lastly, these remakes need to have the post game activities that allow for players to keep coming to the games for new content.

![Battle Frontier](/images/pokemon/Sinnoh_Battle_Frontier_Logo.png){:width="100px" height="100px"}
The games need to have the full Battle Frontier that appeared in Pokémon Platinum. They cannot be allowed to get away with what was done in the Hoenn remakes. This would give great post game content which can extend the lifetime of the game for those who don't do competitive online.

![Wifi Plaza](/images/pokemon/Wifi_Plaza.png){:width="108px" height="100px"}
The Wifi Plaza also needs to be in these games, but they need to be improved such that their activities are available offline. This cannot be like the original games where the shutdown of the Wireless Services removed a set of mini games from the game.
