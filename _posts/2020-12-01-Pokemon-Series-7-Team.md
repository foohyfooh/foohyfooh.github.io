I was inspired by [Speshel's](https://twitter.com/Speshel_) [Electivire + Tapu Koko Team](https://pokepast.es/e70d6b6db540a6fa) and decided to try to make my own version of the team. I started with Electivire and Choice Scarf Tapu Koko, and then added from there. I wanted to ensure I could use Discharge without the risk of damaging my own Pokémon so I went with Landorus since it is Ground Type and Telepathy Tapu Fini. The spreads are just simple spreads, but it works well enoughh. Then, to complete the team I went with [Aaron "Cybertron" Zheng's](https://twitter.com/CybertronVGC) Galarian Moltres and Comfey spreads from his [Galarian Moltres Team](https://pokepast.es/8a7a376329035cf1). And, Galarain Moltres kind of fits the criteria of not get hit by ally moves when paired with Landorus Therian.

The main leads from this team are either
1. Electivire and Tapu Koko. As you continue to use Discharge, Electivire will quickly start to outspeed opponent Pokémon.
2. Comfey and Galarian Moltres. This usually is the simple activate Weakness Policy and attack until you can't mode.

Usual choices for Pokémon in the back
1. Tapu Fini. I usually take this Pokémon with me because I don't have any other means of speed control if Electivire faints.
2. Comfey. Since I usually lead Electivire, Comfey can be a good choice for late game heals to ensure that I have a fast Pokémon remaining that can continue to deal damage to my opponent.
3. Landorus Therian. This Pokémon comes in handy since it can be used for cycling Intimidate with the help of Tapu Koko.
