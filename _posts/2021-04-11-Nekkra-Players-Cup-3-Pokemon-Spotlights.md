[Rosemary "Nekkra" Kelley](https://twitter.com/NekkraGaming) has a [Pokemon Spotlights Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrq2Cq_O6NozQpypqhFzz-0NPs70HESlF) where she discusses Pokémon that are commenly used in the VGC meta. During the [Pokémon Players Cup 3](https://www.pokemon.com/us/play-pokemon/pokemon-players-cup-iii/about/) Region Finals streams, Nekkra provided some of these spotlights for the Pokémon Company, and since there aren't any separate videos for them yet, I have recorded the timestamps from the streams here for the Pokémon that were covered. Click on the Pokémon to view the spotlights.
