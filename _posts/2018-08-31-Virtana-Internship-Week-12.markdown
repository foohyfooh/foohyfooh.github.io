This week at [Virtana](https://virtanatech.com/) has been spent attempting to build upon my work from [last week](/posts/2018/08/24/Virtana-Internship-Week-11). I have been working on the Unity Simulation.

I have been trying to get the Unity simulation to a state where it can perform the necessary tasks for the entire system. I have added a fake robot arm to the simulation, and I am trying to get calibration working for the Unity simulation.

This week also brings and end to my internship and to these blog posts.
