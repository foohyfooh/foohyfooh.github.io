I updated my Electivire + Tapu Koko Team that was last described [here](/posts/2020/12/18/Pokemon-Series-7-Team-Followup) to play in the [Pokémon Players Cup 3 Qualifiers](https://www.pokemon.com/us/play-pokemon/pokemon-players-cup-iii/about/). The changes that I made are as follows.

The first thing that I did was remove everything other than Electivire + Tapu Koko as a way to reduce the chance that I just pick the same Pokémon that I already had and not make major changes. Then, I chose Thundurus Therian as another Pokémon with Discharge and the added benefit of Volt Absorb when matched with Tapu Koko. I just basically added the best coverage moves I could think of as the last part of that. I changed Tapu Koko from Choice Scarf to Focus Sash sine getting one shot was a common issue for me and most of the Pokémon I encountered weren't fast enough to outspeed when Tapu Koko didn't have the Choice Scarf, and I wanted to switch moves away from Discharge to not hurt Galarian Moltres. The Pokémon that were fast enough after the change were those with Choice Scarf themselves or those with Unburden. So in most cases it worked out fine.

The latter choices were to give me coverage and build a reasonable team. I used White Herb Garchomp as opposed to Landorus Therian for my Ground type; the idea I took from [Graham Amedee](https://twitter.com/amedeegraham) while watching his [Players Cup 3 Prep Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgGNMT7qMyqtnmNVtuxJdkMDBoBFf65KC). The downside of this change was that I lost my Intimidate option, but it does have the benefit of Rough Skin which gets good chip damage on Pokémon. I added Heatran since I didn't have much Fire coverage other than Fire Punch on Electivire, and there was also the added benefit of getting Steel type coverage. The last Pokémon that was added was Galarian Zapdos. Picking it was a mix of just to try it out and to add Taunt to the team.

With that out of the way, I played in the Pokémon Players Cup 3 Qualifiers. One thing I didn't do was record the details of my matches, but from some of the things that I know I lost to were
- Regigigas + Weezing.
- successful Trick Room setup. Once it was setup, I couldn't get back momentum against them especially against bulky Pokémon like Glastrier.

These suggest that I might need something like Will-o-Wisp so that I can limit my opponent's ability to push forward.

And, here are the results:
